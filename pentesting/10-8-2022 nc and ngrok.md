# Kali Linux tooling

## Goals

- Understand tooling for gaining shell access
- Be able to, willingly, create a remote shell
- Write a file to the desktop

## Research

Netcat and ngrok I know can be used.

Victim - Window 11 dev vbox
ip 10.0.2.15

Attacker - Kali vbox
ip 10.0.2.15

Well then we need to get them on the same network. Been a while since I worked on vms

### VM Network setting

### Create a network

- In VirtualBox go to tool
- Click the screwdrive for preferences
- Go to network
- Add a NatNetwork
  -- Name it
  -- Save it

### Add box to the network

- Go to the box and click the setting cog.
- Go to the Network tab
- Change to NatNetwork
  -- Chose the name created
  -- I added allow VM

## Netcat

This is a way to make the attacking machine listen for a connection

The attack vector in this case since we are on the same network is to get the victim to call out to the nc listener

To make this easy I can use https://www.revshells.com/ for the ip and port and the cli that I am trying to access ie powershell.

This was an extrem case. I ended up looking up the code in the victim.

I had to turn anti-virus off :(

The powershell commands would either not run or crashed the machine.

I installed python and was able to run it from there.

## NGROK

Tunnel to allow things to be on the internet. Not need in this local example

# Next steps

I want to get the powershell commands to work.
Try to do this over the internet

Should add some photos
