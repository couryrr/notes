# Network Namping and Packet sniffing

## Goals

Find the machine on the network

```
nmap -F <network>/<cider>
```

## Issues

Need to figure out how to set up this lab env a bit better. I am not running things on docker/k8s yet.
The ubuntu server seems to use a cloud init tool. Still digging into it.

Kali seems fine but the image seemed to get installed oddly.

Windows is dev and has an expired license

Vagrant keeps popping up so I might be able to use that tool still?

## Changes in direction

Trying to understand cloud-init and vitual box

Found some docs

- https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html
- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-cloud-config-scripting
- https://web.archive.org/web/20150119071718/http://indieboxproject.org/blog/2014/10/virtualbox-and-cloud-init/

I was able to run the commands using wsl and have a config.vdmx... but nothing seems to work in that. I am not sure what the file name needs to be :(

Something I would like to watch that I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs8yOmTJNYQ

Lets watch this not get an answer or down voted to hell

## OMG something that worked!!!

https://www.how2shout.com/linux/install-ubuntu-20-04-22-04-cloud-image-minimal-on-virtualbox/#3_Download_SeedISO_file
Used the amazon cloud-init https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/2.0.20190612/README.cloud-init

Need a way to create iso images on windows. Trying ChristianKindahl.InfraRecorder

```
winget install ChristianKindahl.InfraRecorder
```

That was no good >\_<

Looking like for the time I will need to use wsl.

The internet has a debate for the best too to use. I can create it with what I have so I am going to use it.
