# Recon of a site

## Full transparency

Looking all over the site for any kind of clues I was stuck.

It was just a page that lead nowhere and I spent way too much time on burpsuite which I would like to remove.

So I cheated :s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UGIfoIZw6Y

This was super helpful though and now I know a bunch more tools to use.

## What I did

Enumeration is the name of the game. I needed a way to find something else on this site.

---

I did find that burp seems very limited without the paid version. Probably not worth keeping installed tbh.

---

Also, not sure about skipfish seems promising buit minus a nice html page it did not find anything for me :s

---

dirb is :100: what I was looking for (found it on my own too not the video). It seems light weight.

_Note: kali keeps wordlist here: /usr/share/wordlists_

It found that /admin 302 redirected which got me to a login!

---

I tried sqlmap on the form but had no success. It appears that this does not exploit nosql :skull:.

Based on the referenced video I was able to find the correct test.

**I would like to find a nosqlmap**

---

Using the same nosql exploit I was able to get the users and hashcat was the way to get through those.

---

This is where I was lost. I tried sshing but nadda

What I was missing was a reccon for other domains. I am not sure what tool kali comes with but gobuster was an easy install and worked super great.

A good source of wordlists:

In the end here is what happened:

1. Scan site with `dirb` and `gobuster`/`ffuf`
   1. Honestly probably could walk awa
   2. Need to make sure the thread are lower on the vm
   3. Make sure to use a good word list.
2. Once the form was found attack it
   1. This time it was nosql injection
   2. Not sure how to tell nosql vs sql
   3. `sqlmap` does not assist in nosql?
   4. Got me in as admin.
3. If one form is sql inject suceptiable the other is too
   1. This exfilled users and hash
   2. If you get a hash `hashcat` with a word list.
4. With the subdomain mattermost login with the above
   1. exploring showed a new user setup creds
   2. ssh in as that user

## Things to remember

`sudo -l` - will list the command a user can run as sudo
`file <name>` - this can tell you the file type (need to figure out more about decompiling)

GTFObin Site - A good place to get elevated account.
