## mitm proxy

The proxy nees to run and it will create certs in `~/.mitmproxy`

Need to move the certs to the folder `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra` it does not exists

`sudo cp ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/mitmproxy-ca-cert.crt`

> .cer to crt is correct

`sudo update-ca-certificates` to update the system

Also, need to import the cert into FireFox

`cp ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer ~/Desktop/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer`

> The uploaded cannot see `.mitmproxy` dir

go to Setting > Privacy & Security > View Certs > Import

choose the file on the Desktop
